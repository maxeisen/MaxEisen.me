# Get to Know Max Eisen
This is my personal website - currently a web version of my resume with some nice, interactive, responsive elements, but soon to be a cooler, more complex website.
Initially just a fun project during COVID-19 quarantine, this turned into a great way to showcase past projects, work experience, and more.

Deployed to [maxeisen.me](https://maxeisen.me) - thanks, Netlify.
