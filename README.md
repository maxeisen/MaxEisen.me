# Get to Know Max Eisen
This is my personal website - previously a web version of my resume with some nice, interactive, responsive elements, and now a cooler, more complex website showcasing personal projects, professional experience, and more.

Deployed to [maxeisen.me](https://maxeisen.me) - check it out!

## Development
To install and work on the website locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxeisen/maxeisen.github.io.git MaxEisen.me

npm install
```

To run local server in develop mode:

npm run dev
```

To build and serve website locally (rollup):

```

## Versions
