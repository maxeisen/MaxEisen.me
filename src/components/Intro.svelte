<h1 class="section-title-intro">My Name is Max Eisen...</h1>
<div class="intro-paragraph">
    <p class="title-extension">and I am a Computer Science student at <a class="intro-link" href="https://www.queensu.ca/" target="_blank">Queen's University</a> with a fascination for technology.</p>
    <p>I am also a computational thinker who enjoys programming, software and web development, beta testing, automation, and UI/UX design. In my free time, you can find me skiing, hiking, travelling, playing guitar, and trying new tech.</p>
    <p>Although I spend a fair amount of time in front of a computer, I am also a social person who prefers to work with, and be around others. Whether with a project team, a customer, a supervisor, or friends, I strive to communicate effectively and confidently.</p>
    <p>Feel free to explore my website, click on things for more information, and <a class="intro-link" href="mailto:max.eisen@queensu.ca" target="_blank">email me</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p>
